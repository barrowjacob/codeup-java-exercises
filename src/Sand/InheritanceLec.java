    //constructor rules:
    //has to be public
    //name of method has to match name of class
    //=============================================

                //*************
                //FIRST CLASS
                //*************


    //public class Person {

    //}
    //*************
    //SECOND CLASS
    //*************

    //public class Employee extends Person
    // {
    //      public Employee() {
    //          super.
    //      }
    //
    // }

    //if you get a DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR error, don't just make new, empty constructor from super class.
    // instead, use super and pass through parameters from the parent



    //IF OVERRIDING:
    //state with '@' that you are intentionally overriding something (intellij doesn't like it, but whatever)
    //AS EXAMPLE:
    //    @Override
    ////    public int getArea(int width, int length){
    ////        System.out.println("...getting diff area...");
    ////        return width * 2;
    ////    }
